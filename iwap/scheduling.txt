Using Butterfly Scheduling requires 3 steps: 

Create a SchedulerService instance 
Add Tasks 
Call run() 


Creating a SchedulerService
To use Butterfly Scheduling you must first create a SchedulerService. Here is how that is done: 

SchedulerService schedulerService = new SchedulerService();



Adding Tasks
In order to get the SchedulerService to actually do anything sensible, you need to add some tasks to it. 

Here is an example that adds a task to be executed once a day, at 23:30:00 (11:30:00 PM): 

IscheduledTask myTask = new MyTask();

schedulerService.addDailyScheduledTask(myTask, 23, 30, 0);

There are a few more convenience methods for adding tasks to be scheduled at certain intervals, daily, weekly, monthly etc. 

You can also create your own ISchedulingStrategy if you need more complex scheduling strategies. Just implement the ISchedulingStrategy, and add your task by calling this method: 

IscheduledTask myTask = new MyTask();

ISchedulingStrategy mySchedulingStrategy = new MySchedulingStrategy();
    
shedulerService.addScheduledTask(myTask, mySchedulingStrategy)



Calling run()
To start the SchedulerService you need to call the run() method. You can call the run() method directly, or start a Thread and pass the SchedulerService to it. Here is how the code looks in those two cases: 

//Run in current thread
schedulerService.run();

//Run in new thread
Thread thread = new Thread(schedulerService);
thread.start();
